2015 - Present
: **Graduate Researcher**, Memorial University of Newfoundland (St. John's, Canada)

    - Derived new electric fields and radar cross-section expressions for monostatic and bistatic HF Radars observing ocean surfaces with extreme wave heights
    - Developed a 37% more accurate wind speed estimator for buoy data using a NARX Neural Network
    - Simulated more than 200 combinations of ocean conditions and noise levels and generated noise-contaminated radar cross-sections of the ocean surface using Matlab and Python, and developed a new nonlinear method to extract ocean information from noisy bistatic HF radar data from the ocean surface, achieving an average of 97.2\% accuracy
    - Aided in in-situ maintenance of HF radar sites in the Avalon Peninsula
    - Collaborated with other researchers in the implementation of feature extraction and classification methods for GNSS-R and X-band marine radar images

Oct. 2018 - Feb. 2019 
: **Research Assistant**, C-CORE (St. John's, Canada)

    - Simulated the radar cross-section of a satellite calibration standard using Altair FEKO and Ansys HFSS and determined the roughness requirements to have a minimum impact on the radar cross-section
    - Aided in the choice of supporting structures by simulating the use of different materials and geometries to minimize their impact on the radar cross-section

2010-2014 
: **Undergraduate Researcher**, Instituto Federal da Bahia (Salvador, Brazil)

    - Constructed a magnetic 6-DOF motion tracker using Arduino and Matlab, and developed an alternative closed-form solution to the tracking problem using Singular Value Decomposition
    - Coded an automatic FEM mesh generator and a time varying electromagnetic FEM simulator in Fortran and C, which were used to evaluate the impact of sea proximity on electromagnetic field propagation
    - Investigated the implementation of data fusion for underwater mine detection using machine learning
    - Implemented an unsupervised neural network algorithm in *Fortran* to identify fixed and moving underwater objects in ULF EM data, and compensated for reducing the number of sensors in the simulations
    - Used Finite Elements Method to construct a Poisson Equation solver in *C*, and analyzed numerical errors introduced by different FEM meshing techniques
