I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the [Memorial University of Newfoundland](http://www.mun.ca), studying electromagnetic scattering applied to radio oceanography. My research is focused on the use of distributions to represent the geometry of scattering bodies, and how it impacts the derivation of field expressions and cross-sections.

I have a Masters in Electrical Engineering from the Memorial University of Newfoundland in 2017, where I studied the use of nonlinear regularization to the extraction of ocean spectral information from high-frequency radar data. I also have a Bachelor in Industrial Electrical Engineering from the [Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia da Bahia (IFBA)](http://www.ifba.edu.br), in Salvador, Brazil, where I spent three years as an Undergraduate Research Assistant, working on computational geometry, FEM, computational electromagnetics and machine learning.

2015 - Present
: **Graduate Researcher**, Memorial University of Newfoundland (St. John's, Canada)

    - Derived new electric fields and radar cross-section expressions for monostatic and bistatic HF Radars observing ocean surfaces with extreme wave heights
    - Developed a 37% more accurate wind speed estimator for buoy data using a NARX Neural Network in *Matlab*
    - Developed a new nonlinear method to extract ocean information from noisy bistatic HF radar data from the ocean surface, achieving an average of 97.2\% accuracy on noisy data simulated in *Matlab*
    - Collaborated with other researchers in the implementation of feature extraction and classification methods for GNSS-R and X-band marine radar images

Oct. 2018 - Feb. 2019 
: **Research Assistant**, C-CORE (St. John's, Canada)

    - Simulated the radar cross-section of a satellite calibration standard using *Altair FEKO* and *Ansys HFSS* and determined the roughness requirements to have a minimum impact on the radar cross-section
    - Aided in the choice of supporting structures by simulating the use of different materials and geometries to minimize their impact on the radar cross-section

2010-2014 
: **Undergraduate Researcher**, Instituto Federal da Bahia (Salvador, Brazil)

    - Constructed a magnetic 6-DOF motion tracker using Arduino and *Matlab*, and developed an alternative closed-form solution to the tracking problem using Singular Value Decomposition
    - Evaluated the impact of sea proximity on electromagnetic field propagation using an automatic FEM mesh generator and a time varying electromagnetic FEM simulator written in *Fortran* and *C*
    - Implemented an unsupervised neural network algorithm in *Fortran* to identify fixed and moving underwater objects in ULF EM data, and compensated for reducing the number of sensors in the simulations
    - Used Finite Elements Method to construct a Poisson Equation solver in *C*, and analyzed numerical errors introduced by different FEM meshing techniques
