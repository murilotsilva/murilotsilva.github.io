Hi! I'm Murilo Silva. I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the [Memorial University of Newfoundland](http://www.mun.ca){:target="_blank"}. I am currently researching the effects of large ocean waves on the electromagnetic scattering for high-frequency radars, and I have previously worked with inverse problems and machine learning applied to spectral and meteorological data related to the ocean environment. I'm also the Communications Officer of the [IEEE Newfoundland and Labrador Section](http://ieeenl.ca){:target="_blank"} since 2019.

I was born and raised in Salvador, Brazil, and moved to Canada in 2015 for my masters. In my free time I love listening to music, playing volleyball, and sometimes I try to play the guitar.
