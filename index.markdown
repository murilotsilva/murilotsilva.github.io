Hi! My name is Murilo Silva, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the [Memorial University of Newfoundland](http://www.mun.ca){:target="_blank"} working on removing restrictions from the scattering theory for high-frequency radars applied to radio oceanography. I have previously worked with inverse problems and machine learning applied to spectral and meteorological data related to the ocean. I am interested in electromagnetic scattering theory, inverse problems, and data science.

I was born and raised in Salvador, Brazil, and moved to Canada in 2015 for my masters. In my free time I love listening to music, playing volleyball, and sometimes trying to play the guitar.

I'm also the Communications Officer of the [IEEE Newfoundland and Labrador Section](http://ieeenl.ca){:target="_blank"} since 2019.
