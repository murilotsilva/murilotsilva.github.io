  name: HF Radar Scattering over Ocean Surfaces with Electromagnetically Large Waves
  subtitle: Removing the small-heights restriction from the HF radar scattering theory
  status: ongoing
  description: >
    High-frequency (HF) radars have been employed over the years in the remote sensing of the ocean surface, 
    either for target detection, or for meteorological and oceanographic studies of the ocean surface itself.
    To understand the multiple phenomena occurring on the ocean surface, researchers have developed models for
    the radar cross-section (RCS) of the ocean surface, allowing for the development of techniques to extract 
    meteorological and spectral information from the ocean surface. One common restriction applied in the
    derivation of these RCS expressions is the <i>small-height approximation</i>, which restricts the practical
    application of the derived theories to electromagnetically small waves. The goal of this project is to derive
    the RCS of the ocean surface without the small-heights approximation, allowing for the analysis of data gathered
    from ocean surfaces with electromagnetically large waves.

    <!--- <p>Historical ocean data allow for the study of previous events and testing of
    mathematical models in the ocean environment. The use of estimation 
    techniques and models on historical data, commonly referred to as 
    hindcasting, is widely used in climate sciences for long-term climate 
    analysis, as well as in oceanography for surface wave analysis. </p> --->
    
    <p> Wave estimation methods have greatly evolved in the past 50 years, with 
      different empirical and theoretical models being proposed with increasing 
      complexity, encompassing the evolution in computational processing 
      capabilities. While there is a vast array of literature on the estimation 
      of ocean measurements from wind data, methods dedicated to the prediction 
      of wind speed from ocean measurements are less common. </p> 
      
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to employ machine learning to the development 
        of a wind speed estimation method that would be sensitive enough to 
        estimate sudden peaks within data gaps using significant wave height 
        measurements.

  name: Nonlinear extraction of the directional ocean wave spectrum from noisy bistatic HF radar data
  subtitle: Inversion of HF radar data using nonlinear Tikhonov regularization in Hilbert scales
  status: closed
  description: >
    Due to its ubiquity and relative geometrical and mathematical simplicity, 
    numerous methods have been developed for the extraction of ocean wave 
    spectral information from data obtained by monostatic HF radars, using both
    linear and nonlinear approximations. The goal of this project is to develop
    a nonlinear extraction method to obtain spectral information from the ocean
    surface from bistatic HF radar data. Since the data obtained from the ocean
    surface is usually noisy, the technique chosen for this task was the 
    Tikhonov regularization in Hilbert scales.

  name: Analytical solution to the estimation of position and orientation using a 6-DOF magnetic tracker
  subtitle: 
  status: closed
  description: >
    <p> Accurate estimation of the position and orientation of a body with 
    respect to a reference frame is a problem that frequently arises in 
    computer vision and robotics. Electromagnetic (EM) trackers have been 
    widely studied and employed in applications that require a high level 
    of accuracy &mdash; e.g. medical applications such as image-guided surgery,
    virtual reality, and motion capture. Recent research on EM trackers has 
    focused on the mitigation of environmental interferences and other sources
    of error. However, methods to estimate position and orientation have not 
    developed on the same pace.</p>

    <!--- <p>The pioneering paper on 6-DOF EM motion tracking describes a recursive
    algorithm that uses consecutive rotations and linear transformations to 
    obtain the relative position and orientation of the tracked body. Later,
    matrix-based closed-form solutions and quaternion-based iterative 
    approximations using methods were developed.</p> --->

    <p>The goal of this project was to develop an alternative analytical 
    solution to the 6-DOF electromagnetic tracking problem. The method relies
    on the Singular Value Decompostion of the current matrices at the tracker
    and source, and then, using the mathematical method described in the 
    original paper, try to derive physical meaning from the decomposed matrix.</p>

    <p>The method devised in this project was able to accurately estimate the
    position and orientation of a virtual sensor under noisy conditions. </p>

  subtitle: Capturing data behaviour using unsupervised neural networks
  status: closed
  description: >
    <p>This was a project supported by the Brazilian Navy, with the overall 
    goal of employing machine learning to aid in the classification of static 
    and underwater threats using the information gathered by multiple sensors. 
    My contribution to the project was the implementation of an unsupervised 
    neural network to capture the general behaviour of ULF electromagnetic 
    fields received using ocean surface EM sensors, providing high-probability 
    data points to reduce the number of processing data points to a significant
    data group while upsampling the sensor grid.
