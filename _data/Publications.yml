  abstract: "The use of Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction applied to underwater object detection with Low Frequency Electromagnetic Waves is presented. Computer simulation is used to generate a direct model for the study region, and a Self Organizing Map Algorithm is used to fit the data and return a similar model, with smaller dimensionality and same characteristics. Results show that virtual sensors are created by the SOM algorithm with consistent predictions, filling the resolution gap of the input data. These results are useful for fastening decision making algorithms by reducing the number of inputs to a group of significant data."

  volume: "16"
  abstract: "An alternative analytical solution to six degrees-of-freedom position and attitude estimation problem is proposed. The proposed method relies on the use of Singular Value Decomposition to the transformation matrix between the currents in the transmitter and in the receiver. The proposed method is validated using synthetic data, in which a random motion is applied to the transmitter within an environment with different levels of noise. Once the efficacy of the method is confirmed, the proposed algorithm is benchmarked against a well established closed-form solution. The presented method was able to accurately obtain the position and orientation, with performance comparable to the benchmark."

  title: "A nonlinear approach to ocean wave spectrum extraction from bistatic HF-radar data"
  year: "2017"
  type: "M.Eng. Thesis"
  abstract: "In this thesis, a new approach to the extraction of the directional ocean wave spectrum from bistatic high frequency (HF) radar data is proposed. The proposed method relies on the simplification of the second-order bistatic radar cross-section, analogous to the one presented by Shahidi and Gill [1] for the monostatic case, to facilitate the use of nonlinear optimization methods, such as regularized nonlinear least-squares. Initially, the historic development of the techniques related to the extraction of the ocean wave spectrum from HF radar data is provided in order to contextualize the work of this thesis. Then, an overview of the theory related to ocean waves and the bistatic radar cross-section is shown. Later, the nonlinear optimization method used in this thesis, Tikhonov regularization in Hilbert spaces, is explained, as well as the theoretical background necessary to understand the method. Once the theory is laid out, the simplification of the second-order bistatic HF radar cross section is presented. The simplification consists of a change of variables that allow the use of the “sifting” property of the Dirac delta function. This reduces the dependence of the second-order bistatic cross-section to a single variable. After the simplification process is shown, the methodology for extracting the directional ocean wave spectrum from bistatic HF radar data is discussed. As a proof-of-concept, the method is initially applied to the second-order bistatic cross section, without the presence of noise. The method successfully extracted the directional ocean wave spectrum without assuming any function model for the nondirectional ocean wave spectrum, and assuming a cosine-power model for the directional spreading function. Next, the first-order bistatic HF radar cross section is added to the second-order cross section, and the proposed method is applied, still without noise present. The proposed method was also able to extract the directional ocean wave spectrum and very low error is added by the inclusion of the first-order cross section. Finally, different levels of noise are added to the cross section including the first and second- orders, and the presented method is applied for the extraction. Again, the method yields good results, with acceptable levels of error for the different noise levels. This new approach to the extraction of the directional ocean wave spectrum from bistatic HF radar data presents, to the author's knowledge, the first nonlinear extraction method for bistatic HF radar data. Further developments of the technique, such as the use of different nonlinear extraction methods, or a general directional spreading function, are suggested."

  abstract: "The present work proposes the use of empirical functions for determining the initial value for the nonlinear extraction of the directional ocean wave spectrum from bistatic High-Frequency Surface Wave Radar (HFSWR) Doppler data. Once the initialization parameters have been defined using these empirical expressions, a blind iterative algorithm based on Tikhonov regularization in Hilbert Scales is used to extract the nondirectional spectrum. The extracted spectrum is then used to determine the directional factor, which is assumed to be described by a cosine-power model. The proposed method yields good results with synthetic noise-contaminated HFSWR data with a priori regularization parameters."

  abstract: "The main purpose of this work is to develop a electromagnetic position and orientation tracker with six degrees of freedom. Initially is presented an academic approach of Linear Algebra and Electromagnetism con- cepts required to understand the motion tracker working principles. Once theoretical requisites are met, physical and mathematical model of the system is described, with the techniques for inversion of the system. After modelling considerations, the use of partial information of the sensor is considered. A new inversion method, based on singular value decomposition of the linear transform matrix, is presented. Following the theoretical concepts related to the inversion of the system, the prototype cons- truction is persented, detailing the assembly process, controllers programming and the circuit elements and structure. From the prototype, the inversion process is applied on acquired data, obtaining the position information using nonlinear programming, and position and orientation information using the new singular value decomposition-based method. Both methods present good results for the inversion, with precision similar to commercial sensors in the nonlinear programming case, and zero error for the simulated data inversion using the singular value decomposition-based method."

  abstract: "This work presents the use of a nonlinear autoregressive neural network to obtain an improved estimate of sea surface winds, taking Placentia Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, as a study case. The network inputs and delays were chosen through cross correlation with the target variable. The proposed method was compared with five other wind speed estimation techniques, outperforming them in correlation, precision, accuracy, and bias levels. As an extension, the temporal gap filling of missing wind speed data during a storm has been considered. Data containing a measurement gap from a 40-yr windstorm that hit the same location has been used. The proposed method filled the gaps in the dataset with a high degree of correlation with measurements obtained by surrounding stations. The method presented in this work showed promising results that could be extended to estimate wind speeds in other locations and filling gaps in other datasets. 1."

  volume: "2017-Octob"
  abstract: "Knowledge of the ocean wave spectrum, from which many important ocean parameters can be extracted, is crucial to understand the ocean's behaviour. Due to the intricate nature of ocean wave spectrum extraction from HF radar data, previously-devised methods relied on making a linear approximation to the original nonlinear problem or resorted to constraining the solution space, in order to simplify the solution process. This problem is aggravated in a bistatic configuration due to its geometrical complexity. The present work proposes a change of variables in the second-order radar cross-section from bistatic HF-Radar in order to extract the ocean power spectral density from Doppler HF-Radar data. The main advantage of the proposed method is the possibility of extracting the ocean wave spectrum without assuming any linear approximation to the inverse problem. In this work, it is found that the proposed method can accurately extract the ocean wave spectrum from bistatic HF radar data under a variety of ocean conditions."
