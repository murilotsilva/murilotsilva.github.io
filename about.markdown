# Murilo T. Silva, M.Eng.

<img align="right" width="40%" hspace="10" src="figs/profile.jpg" />
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the [Memorial University of Newfoundland](http://www.mun.ca), studying electromagnetic scattering applied to radio oceanography. My research is focused on the use of distributions to represent the geometry of scattering bodies, and how it impacts the derivation of field expressions and cross-sections.

I have a Masters in Electrical Engineering from the Memorial University of Newfoundland in 2017, where I studied the use of nonlinear regularization to the extraction of ocean spectral information from high-frequency radar data. I also have a Bachelor in Industrial Electrical Engineering from the [Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia da Bahia (IFBA)](http://www.ifba.edu.br), in Salvador, Brazil, where I spent three years as an Undergraduate Research Assistant, working on computational geometry, FEM, computational electromagnetics and machine learning.
